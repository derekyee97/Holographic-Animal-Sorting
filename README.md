Implemented a learning program to teach popular sorting algorithms and deploying on the Microsoft HoloLens.

Scripts are created in C# using Microsoft Visual Studios, and the program itself was built in Unity.

### Example of what the sorting scene animation will look like. It plays through an animation of the specified sort using animals that sort by the number above the animal's body.

### Example of what the testing portion of the program will look liek. Users will tap the box corresponding to where they believe the animal that stepped forward should go. If correct the boxes turn green and the animation continues, otherwise an error message will replace the prompt and ask the user to tap again.
